   This is the user manual of the solution checker of [[file:index.org][ASPRILO]].

* Encoding Architecture

  The encoding for verification is compartmentalized into several categories reflecting

  1. the problem domain

     - stored in =./checker/encodings/<domain>/= .e.g.
       =./checker/encodings/default/= for the default domain

  2. the types of laws used for planning, that is,

     1. /action executability/: possible actions based on preconditions

        - stored in =./checker/encodings/<domain>/actions=

     2. /action effects/: effects after an action execution and the state
        of the environment

        - stored in =./checker/encodings/<domain>/effects=

     3. /static laws/: state constraints and transitions solely based on
        the current state of the environment (fluents)

        - stored in=./checker/encodings/<domain>/states=
