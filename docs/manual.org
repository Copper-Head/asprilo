* About

  This is the user manual of *ASPRILO*, a robotic intra-logistics benchmark suite for answer set programming.
  In the following, we will primarily
   - describe the problem from a conceptual as well as technical perspective
   - introduce a referential set of benchmark instances
   - introduce various tools such as an instance generator, solution checker and visualizer

  # - For a general description of the problem, see [[#cid:75192d41-bc59-476b-a0ac-4bb680aa5984][Problem Specification]]
  # - For technical details on encodings and benchmarking, see [[id:60883964-d923-43c5-962b-aab0780f7639][Encoding and Benchmarking]]
  # - For a brief overview of local resources and external references, see [[id:4f383ee0-fe94-4d6b-8dea-9b303431904e][Resources]]
